##### 6. Why are these series of books called "You Don't Know JavaScript"?

> Most of JS developers don't know the language itself, we have been taught that JavaScript has "good parts" and "bad parts" which we should avoid at all cost without deeply understanding what is behind the, so unfairly called, "flaws" in the language. One example of that will be __coercion__. So, these books challenge you to go beyond your comfort zone and ask deeper "why" questions to every single behavior you may encounter.
